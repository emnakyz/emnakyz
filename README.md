My journey in software development began at Maltepe University. Currently, I am enhancing my skills in two areas as a web developer, focusing on both frontend and backend. Throughout my time in the industry, I have participated in numerous projects. I am open to working with new technologies. In my projects, I primarily use C# Asp .Net Core MVC, C# Asp.Net Framework MVC, Asp.Net Core web API, JavaScript, and jQuery. I have also been involved in projects with Angular on the frontend. I have experience with TFS, Git, Github, and Bitbucket. On the database side, I am proficient in MSSQL, PostgreSql, MongoDB, and PLSQL. I am confident in problem-solving and teamwork.
